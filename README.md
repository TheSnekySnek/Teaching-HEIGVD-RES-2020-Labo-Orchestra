# Teaching-HEIGVD-RES-2020-Labo-Orchestra

## Admin

* **You can work in groups of 2 students**.
* It is up to you if you want to fork this repo, or if you prefer to work in a private repo. However, you have to **use exactly the same directory structure for the validation procedure to work**. 
* We expect that you will have more issues and questions than with other labs (because we have a left some questions open on purpose). Please ask your questions on Telegram / Teams, so that everyone in the class can benefit from the discussion.

## Objectives

This lab has 4 objectives:

* The first objective is to **design and implement a simple application protocol on top of UDP**. It will be very similar to the protocol presented during the lecture (where thermometers were publishing temperature events in a multicast group and where a station was listening for these events).

* The second objective is to get familiar with several tools from **the JavaScript ecosystem**. You will implement two simple **Node.js** applications. You will also have to search for and use a couple of **npm modules** (i.e. third-party libraries).

* The third objective is to continue practicing with **Docker**. You will have to create 2 Docker images (they will be very similar to the images presented in class). You will then have to run multiple containers based on these images.

* Last but not least, the fourth objective is to **work with a bit less upfront guidance**, as compared with previous labs. This time, we do not provide a complete webcast to get you started, because we want you to search for information (this is a very important skill that we will increasingly train). Don't worry, we have prepared a fairly detailed list of tasks that will put you on the right track. If you feel a bit overwhelmed at the beginning, make sure to read this document carefully and to find answers to the questions asked in the tables. You will see that the whole thing will become more and more approachable.


## Requirements

In this lab, you will **write 2 small NodeJS applications** and **package them in Docker images**:

* the first app, **Musician**, simulates someone who plays an instrument in an orchestra. When the app is started, it is assigned an instrument (piano, flute, etc.). As long as it is running, every second it will emit a sound (well... simulate the emission of a sound: we are talking about a communication protocol). Of course, the sound depends on the instrument.

* the second app, **Auditor**, simulates someone who listens to the orchestra. This application has two responsibilities. Firstly, it must listen to Musicians and keep track of **active** musicians. A musician is active if it has played a sound during the last 5 seconds. Secondly, it must make this information available to you. Concretely, this means that it should implement a very simple TCP-based protocol.

### Instruments and sounds

The following table gives you the mapping between instruments and sounds. Please **use exactly the same string values** in your code, so that validation procedures can work.

| Instrument | Sound         |
|------------|---------------|
| `piano`    | `ti-ta-ti`    |
| `trumpet`  | `pouet`       |
| `flute`    | `trulu`       |
| `violin`   | `gzi-gzi`     |
| `drum`     | `boum-boum`   |

### TCP-based protocol to be implemented by the Auditor application

* The auditor should include a TCP server and accept connection requests on port 2205.
* After accepting a connection request, the auditor must send a JSON payload containing the list of <u>active</u> musicians, with the following format (it can be a single line, without indentation):

```
[
  {
  	"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
  	"instrument" : "piano",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:20:50.731Z"
  },
  {
  	"uuid" : "06dbcbeb-c4c8-49ed-ac2a-cd8716cbf2d3",
  	"instrument" : "flute",
  	"activeSince" : "2016-04-27T05:39:03.211Z"
  }
]
```

### What you should be able to do at the end of the lab


You should be able to start an **Auditor** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d -p 2205:2205 res/auditor
```

You should be able to connect to your **Auditor** container over TCP and see that there is no active musician.

```
$ telnet IP_ADDRESS_THAT_DEPENDS_ON_YOUR_SETUP 2205
[]
```

You should then be able to start a first **Musician** container with the following command:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
```

After this, you should be able to verify two points. Firstly, if you connect to the TCP interface of your **Auditor** container, you should see that there is now one active musician (you should receive a JSON array with a single element). Secondly, you should be able to use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP datagrams generated by the **Musician** container.

You should then be able to kill the **Musician** container, wait 5 seconds and connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor** container. You should see that there is now no active musician (empty array).

You should then be able to start several **Musician** containers with the following commands:

```
$ docker run -d res/musician piano
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician flute
$ docker run -d res/musician drum
```
When you connect to the TCP interface of the **Auditor**, you should receive an array of musicians that corresponds to your commands. You should also use `tcpdump` to monitor the UDP trafic in your system.


## Task 1: design the application architecture and protocols

| #  | Topic |
| --- | --- |
|Question | How can we represent the system in an **architecture diagram**, which gives information both about the Docker containers, the communication protocols and the commands? |
| | *Insert your diagram here...* |
|Question | Who is going to **send UDP datagrams** and **when**? |
| | The musicians will send the UDP datagrams every second |
|Question | Who is going to **listen for UDP datagrams** and what should happen when a datagram is received? |
| | The auditor wil llisten for UDP datagrams, he will the parse the JSON message and check if the UUID is in the list then update the last time it saw it, if not it will add it to the list |
|Question | What **payload** should we put in the UDP datagrams? |
| | I decided to send a JSON payload containing the UUID, instrument and sound |
|Question | What **data structures** do we need in the UDP sender and receiver? When will we update these data structures? When will we query these data structures? |
| | UDP sender: Map with the instruments and the corresponding sounds, payload with a uuid, instrument and sound.<br>UDP receiver: array of musicians containing their uuid, instrument, first seen, and last active. |


## Task 2: implement a "musician" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | In a JavaScript program, if we have an object, how can we **serialize it in JSON**? |
| | We can use JSON.stringify() |
|Question | What is **npm**?  |
| | NPM is a package manager for NodeJS |
|Question | What is the `npm install` command and what is the purpose of the `--save` flag?  |
| | This saves the package to the package.json file so we can tell npm to install it if the package is not present (Like in a new install)  |
|Question | How can we use the `https://www.npmjs.com/` web site?  |
| | We can search for a package name or tag for the package we need  |
|Question | In JavaScript, how can we **generate a UUID** compliant with RFC4122? |
| | We can use the `uuid` package available via `npm`. We can then get it by requiring the package for the v4: `const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');` and doing `uuidv4();`  |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we execute a function on a **periodic** basis? |
| | We can use `setInterval(fn, time)` |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **emit UDP datagrams**? |
| | We can use `dgram` and create a `upd4` socket with it  |
|Question | In Node.js, how can we **access the command line arguments**? |
| | We can access them via the `process.argv` variable  |


## Task 3: package the "musician" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we **define and build our own Docker image**?|
| | We create a `Dockerfile` that defines our image and then build it using `docker build -t name .`  |
|Question | How can we use the `ENTRYPOINT` statement in our Dockerfile?  |
| | `ENTRYPOINT` let's us set the program that will start with our container. By combining it with `CMD` we can override the parameters passed to out app via the docker run command. This will change the paramater in `CMD` but not the `ENTRYPOINT`  |
|Question | After building our Docker image, how do we use it to **run containers**?  |
| | We can start a container by doing `docker run imageName` to start the container  |
|Question | How do we get the list of all **running containers**?  |
| | `docker ps`  |
|Question | How do we **stop/kill** one running container?  |
| | `docker kill id`  |
|Question | How can we check that our running containers are effectively sending UDP datagrams?  |
| | We can use `tcpdump` to see that our container is sending the UDP datagrams  |


## Task 4: implement an "auditor" Node.js application

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | ---  |
|Question | With Node.js, how can we listen for UDP datagrams in a multicast group? |
| | Use `dgram` and create a `upd4` socket like the sender. set the socket as broadcast, set the multicast TTL and add the membership toa multicast address. We can then bind the socket to the UDP port and our address.  |
|Question | How can we use the `Map` built-in object introduced in ECMAScript 6 to implement a **dictionary**?  |
| |  |
|Question | How can we use the `Moment.js` npm module to help us with **date manipulations** and formatting?  |
| | We can use it to write the timestamp for the musicians as well as substracting two dates to tell us the time between them. |
|Question | When and how do we **get rid of inactive players**?  |
| | We get rid of inactive players after 5 seconds of not receiving a message. To do this we run a function every second that checks the time difference between now and the last time the we received a message from the player. If it's 5 or more seconds we delete the entry. |
|Question | How do I implement a **simple TCP server** in Node.js?  |
| | We use the `net` package, by creating a server with the `createServer` function and binding to the desired port and address.|


## Task 5: package the "auditor" app in a Docker image

| #  | Topic |
| ---  | --- |
|Question | How do we validate that the whole system works, once we have built our Docker image? |
| | We can validate the system by starting multiple musicians and an auditor. We check if all the musicians apear on the rcp response from the auditor, then we kill musicians and wait 5 seconds for the ausitor to update the tcp repsonse. We repeat this process multiple times(here 4). |


## Constraints

Please be careful to adhere to the specifications in this document, and in particular

* the Docker image names
* the names of instruments and their sounds
* the TCP PORT number

Also, we have prepared two directories, where you should place your two `Dockerfile` with their dependent files.

Have a look at the `validate.sh` script located in the top-level directory. This script automates part of the validation process for your implementation (it will gradually be expanded with additional operations and assertions). As soon as you start creating your Docker images (i.e. creating your Dockerfiles), you should try to run it.
